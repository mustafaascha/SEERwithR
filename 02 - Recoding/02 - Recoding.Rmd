#Recoding SEER

The data that SEER provides is a bit cryptic. Here, I'll show you some ways to make it look a little better. 

**Note:** I'm pretty sure that my data use agreement said something about not sharing the data, so I simulated data for the purposes of this project. I made sure to include all of the possible values of categorical variables, so that code in this document will still be useful. 

I would walk through the process of recoding these variables, but it's not very exciting. 

Unfortunately, there's no order to the variables to recode. The script will still run, but I recommend running it interactively to keep track of what's going on.
