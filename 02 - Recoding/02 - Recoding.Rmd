#Recoding SEER

The data that SEER provides is a bit cryptic. This shroud of mystery is thickened by my data use agreement with SEER, which said something about not sharing the data. So I simulated data for the purposes of this project. I made sure to include all of the possible values of categorical variables, so that code in this document will still be useful. 

The script included in the "02-Recoding" folder is a bit disorganized, and is from when I was just starting out as a coder. I am happy that I look at it and cringe a little bit because that means I've learned since then, but I also want it to be useful to you. 

If you'd like to use any of this work, feel free. I would just ask that you give credit where credit is due.
