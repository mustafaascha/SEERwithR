#Making SEER work with R  

There are a lot of ways to use SEER with many different kinds of statistical sotware. This project will focus on using SEER data with the R programming language.  

Here's a brief outline of what I'd like to discuss and script: 

[- Obtaining SEER data and making it R-friendly](SEERwithR/tree/master/01-Obtaining\ and\ Assembling\ SEER\ Data.Rmd)
- Recoding variables so that the data is even more R-friendly
- Sex and race matching
- Survival analysis and Cox Hazards for time until second cancer
